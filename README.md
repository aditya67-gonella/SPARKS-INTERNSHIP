# SPARKS-INTERNSHIP

THE COLOR DETECTION PROGRAM ACTUALLY DETECTS THE COLOURS IN THE INPUT IMAGE. HERE WE HAVE USED K-MEANS CLUSTER ALGORITHM TOO FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF COLOR. 
WHEN WE RUN THE PROGRAM A PIE CHART IS DISPLAYED SHOWING ALL THE COLOURS PRESENT IN THE INPUT IMAGE. 
AN ARRAY OF COMBINATION OF COLOURS IS ALSO DISPLAYED ALONG WITH THE PIE CHART.
